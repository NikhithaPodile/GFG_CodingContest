#Question 4
(Number of Expression)
Given an array arr of length n. There are x '+' and y'-' symbols, and an integer target. You need to build an expression by adding '+' or '-' before each integer in the array. Return the count of different expressions built, which evaluates to the target.

Example 1:

Input: n=5 arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1} x=4 y=1 target = 3

Output: 5

Explanation: There are 5 expressions which have 4 '+' and 1 '-', which evaluates to 3.

1+1+1+1+1=3 +1-1+1+1+1=3 +1+1-1+1+1=3 +1+1+1-1+1=3 +1+1+1+1-1=3
Example 2:

Input:

n=1

arr[] = {3}

x=0

y=1

target = 3

Output: 0

Explanation: There is no valid expression that satisfy the conditions.

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countWays() which takes the array arr[] and its size n, x, y, and target as input parameters and returns the number of expressions that satisfy the conditions.

Constraints:

1\le n\le30 0\le arr[i]\le10^{9} 0\le x y ≤ n -109 < target ≤ 109

Note: x + y = n
