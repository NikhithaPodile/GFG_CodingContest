#Question 1
(First Word)

Given a string array dictionary of length n. Your task is to find the first word in the given dictionary. If the dictionary contains duplicates, return "Invalid", else return the first word according to the dictionary order.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3 dictionary[] = {geeksforgeeks, geeks, geek}

Output: geek

Explanation: "geek" is the first word in the dictionary as per dictionary order.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2 dictionary[] = {geek, geek}

Output: Invalid

Explanation: Since, the dictionary contains duplicates, so the answer is "Invalid".

Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 500

1 ≤ |dictionary[i]| ≤ 500
