#Question 2
(Sum Equals Length)

Given an array arr of length n. The problem is to find the length of the longest subarray, such that the sum of the subarray is equal to the length of the subarray. If the subarray doesn't exist, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: n = 8 arr[] = {16, -1, 3, 7, 2, 8, 11, 24}

Output: 5

Explanation: The subarray {-1, 3, -7, 2, 8} satisfies the given condition, as sum is equal to 5, which is same as the subarray length.
Example 2:

Input:

n = 3

arr[] = {2, 3, 4}

Output: -1

Explanation: There is no subarray which satisfies the given condition.

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function longestSubarray() which takes the array arr[] and its size n, as input parameters and returns the length of the longest subarray which satisfies the given condition.

Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 105

6 -10° ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
